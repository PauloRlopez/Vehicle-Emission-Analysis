Using data exploratory analysis and Logistic regression to find out which fuel types contribute to more emissions.

## Overview

Using data exploratory analysis and Logistic regression to find out which fuel types contribute to more emissions.

The report attempted to convince the audience that fueltype1 Co2 emisions were higher than of fueltype2 Co2A emissions. As well as, the report enhances on the fact that alternative fuel vehicles will have overall less annual petroleum consumption, fuel cost, and that combined miles per gallons (MPG) efficiency.

Below is a description of what fueltype1 and fueltype2 are:

**FuelType1** vehicles are considered to be vehicles with a single fuel source. This type of fuel type can be considered non-hybrid.
**FuelType2** are considered to be vehicles with a dual fuel source or with an alternative source (i.e. Electricity). Yet, this vehicles would still used gasoline or diesel. This type can be considered hybrid vehicles.

I would like to thank the following site where all the data was obtained from.

The data comes from the US Department of Energy and details the fuel economy from the year of 1984-2016.
